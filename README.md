I'm a recent graduate of App Academy who has a passion for music, the outdoors, friends, but most of all PROGRAMMING. Throughout my life I've always been involved with live music wether it be at a church or setting up concerts for my city. This along with my passion for being outdoors has truly made me who I am today.
